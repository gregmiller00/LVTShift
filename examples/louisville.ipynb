    "For this analysis, we're going to be applying a **full Land value tax shift** on the **Jefferson County Public Schools tax**. This is the heftiest property tax in Jefferson County, and thus has the highest impact potential from a shift. It also applies to all non-exempt properties in Jefferson County, and has a cap on its millage rate in state law, but not in the constitution. We will ensure that the existing **homestead exemption** continues to apply (but will play with how it does). And, to help navigate politics and ensure we craft a tax that fits with the constitution, we will play with how agricultural land is treated.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also going to present **six different scenarios**:\n",
    "1. The new land value tax applies to all parcels, and exemptions apply to improvements first\n",
    "2. The new land value tax applies to all parcels besides those with current_use of Agricultural with Dwelling and Vacant Agricultural Land (with the latter two groups of parcels maintaining the old uniform property tax), and exemptions apply to improvements first\n",
    "3. The new land value tax applies to all parcels besides Agricultural with Dwelling, and exemptions apply to improvements first\n",
    "4. The new land value tax applies to all parcels, and exemptions apply fully to land\n",
    "5. The new land value tax applies to all parcels besides those with current_use of Agricultural with Dwelling and Vacant Agricultural Land (with the latter two groups of parcels maintaining the old uniform property tax), and exemptions apply fully to land (outside the uniform parcels)\n",
    "6. The new land value tax applies to all parcels besides Agricultural with Dwelling, and exemptions apply fully to land (outside the uniform parcels)\n",
    "\n",
    "These scenarios' resulting columns will be respectively prefixed with sce1_, sce2_, sce3, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "To filter these parcels, we will create six new dataframes, each representing one of the scenarios. Holding the taxes of the agricultural parcels steady will be handled by a new uniform_parcel column that will added in the dataframes that require it. This column will tell the function to add the current tax revenue of that property to the total for calculating the millage rate, but just set its new_tax to its current_tax. \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine how a parcel's exemption will apply, the apply_exemption_to_land flag will be set on the function, determining its behavior with exemption application.\n",

    "- **Millage Rate**: \\\\$7.35 per \\\\$1,000 in assessed value (from 2024 JCPS budget)\n",

    "1. Calculate total exemptions from all exemption amount fields\n",

    "\n",
    "Now for the exciting part - modeling the LVT shift! We'll trial six revenue-neutral policies that shift the full JCPS property tax to land, but test out different outcomes from specific exemptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Ideal LVT Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "Under our ideal proposed system: \n",
    "- **Land** takes on the full weight of the property tax\n",
    "- **Total revenue** remains the same as current system\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula to solve for the building millage rate is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Current Revenue = Land Millage × Total Taxable Land\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agricultural Carve Outs\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two different potential agricultural carve out scenarios, but they are handled by the same formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Current Revenue = (New Land Millage X Total Taxable Non-Uniform Land) + (Current Uniform Millage X Total Taxable Non-Uniform Property)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Exemptions\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal way to handle the constitutionally-manded homestead exemption is to:\n",
    "1. Apply the exemption to building value first\n",
    "2. If the exemption exceeds building value, apply remainder to land value\n",
    "3. Calculate the tax using one of the above formulas depending on the scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "This method ensures properties don't over-benefit from exemptions and maintains the intent of existing tax policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, if politics determines that the burden of an LVT would still be too much on those individuals that the homestead exemption is supposed to protect, we could also apply the exemption directly on the land value of all non-uniform properties. This really dampens the impact of an LVT, and will likely require a modification in the dollar amount of the exemption to ensure its not a blanket handout to those 65+."

    "\n",
    "We'll examine how the tax burden shifts across:\n",
    "- **Residential properties** (single-family, multi-family, condos)\n",
    "- **Commercial properties** (retail, office, industrial)  \n",
    "- **Vacant land** (often sees largest increases under LVT)\n",
    "- **Exempt properties** (government, religious, charitable)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Metrics to Track:\n",
    "- **Count**: Number of properties in each category\n",
    "- **Median tax change**: Typical impact (less affected by outliers)\n",
    "- **Average percentage change**: Overall magnitude of impact\n",
    "- **Percentage with increases**: How many properties see tax increases\n",

    "This analysis helps identify which sectors benefit from the LVT shift (typically developed properties) and which see increased burden (typically land-intensive properties with low improvement ratios).\n"
