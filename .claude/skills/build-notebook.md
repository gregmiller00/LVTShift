# Skill: Build the Notebook

Sub-skill called from `model-city/SKILL.md` Step 3.

This skill defines the canonical 7-section notebook template. Follow it exactly. Do not add sections, do not reorder sections, do not skip the closing pattern.

---

## Notebook Location and Name

```
cities/<city>/model.ipynb
```

Create the directory:
```bash
mkdir -p cities/<city>/data
```

---

## Required Header Constants

Every notebook must define these at the top of a dedicated constants cell:

```python
CITY_NAME = 'fort_collins'     # snake_case, matches analysis/data/<city>.csv
STATE_FIPS = '08'              # 2-digit zero-padded
COUNTY_FIPS = '069'            # 3-digit zero-padded
MODEL_TYPE = 'split_rate_4to1' # or 'abatement_75pct', 'split_rate_10to1', etc.
LAND_IMPROVEMENT_RATIO = 4.0   # for split-rate; omit if abatement

# Parcel-map export (lvt/parcel_map.py) — per-parcel identity columns carried onto the
# GeoParquet + interactive map but NOT the flat cross-city CSV. All optional: set to the
# source column name when the data has it, else None.
PARCEL_ID_COL = 'PARCEL_ID'    # parcel/account number shown to users; None if unavailable
OWNER_NAME_COL = None          # e.g. 'OWNERNME1'
OWNER_ADDRESS_COL = None       # e.g. 'SITEADDRESS'
# Template with a {parcel_id} placeholder linking to the county's public record, e.g.
# 'https://gis.county.gov/parcel?pin={parcel_id}'. None when the assessor portal has no
# stable per-parcel deep link (many session-based CAMA portals do not).
PARCEL_URL_TEMPLATE = None
```

The `STATE_FIPS + COUNTY_FIPS` combined string is the FIPS code passed to Census.

Find a working `PARCEL_URL_TEMPLATE` when you can — the county GIS/CAMA parcel-detail page
often takes the parcel id as a query parameter (test one real id in a browser). Leave it `None`
if the portal is session-based (no stable deep link) rather than emitting a link that 404s.

---

## Kernelspec

The notebook must use the standard `python3` kernel (installed with `ipykernel`, present in any environment that has the repo requirements). Set this in the notebook metadata:

```json
"kernelspec": {
  "display_name": "Python 3",
  "language": "python",
  "name": "python3"
}
```

---

## Section 1 — Imports and Setup

```python
import sys
import json
import os
from pathlib import Path

import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from dotenv import load_dotenv

sys.path.insert(0, '../..')
REPO_ROOT = Path('../..').resolve()
load_dotenv(REPO_ROOT / '.env')

from lvt.cloud_utils import get_feature_data_with_geometry
from lvt.lvt_utils import (
    model_split_rate_tax,
    calculate_current_tax,
    calculate_category_tax_summary,
    print_category_tax_summary,
    save_standard_export,
)
from lvt.census_utils import get_census_data_with_boundaries, match_to_census_blockgroups

# Constants
CITY_NAME = 'fort_collins'
STATE_FIPS = '08'
COUNTY_FIPS = '069'
MODEL_TYPE = 'split_rate_4to1'
LAND_IMPROVEMENT_RATIO = 4.0

DATA_DIR = Path('data')
DATA_DIR.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
```

---

## Section 2 — Fetch / Load Parcel Data

```python
PARCEL_PATH = DATA_DIR / 'parcels.gpq'

if PARCEL_PATH.exists():
    gdf = gpd.read_parquet(PARCEL_PATH)
    print(f"Loaded {len(gdf):,} parcels from cache")
else:
    gdf = get_feature_data_with_geometry(
        dataset_name='larimer_parcels',
        base_url='https://gis.larimer.org/arcgis/rest/services/Parcels/FeatureServer',
        layer_id=0,
        paginate=True,
    )
    # Filter to city
    gdf = gdf[gdf['MUNICIPALITY'] == 'FORT COLLINS'].copy()
    gdf.to_parquet(PARCEL_PATH)
    print(f"Downloaded and cached {len(gdf):,} city parcels")
```

---

## Section 3 — Classify and Validate

Classify property types, identify exempt parcels, and validate against official figures.

```python
# 1. Exemption flag
gdf['full_exmp'] = (gdf['EXEMPT_CODE'].isin(['E', 'GOV', 'EXEMPT'])).astype(int)

# 2. Property category mapping
CATEGORY_MAP = {
    '100': 'Single Family Residential',
    '200': 'Small Multi-Family (2-4 units)',
    '300': 'Large Multi-Family (5+ units)',
    '350': 'Condominium',
    '360': 'Townhome / Rowhouse',
    '370': 'Mixed Use',
    '400': 'Retail / General Commercial',
    '410': 'Office / Commercial Condo',
    '420': 'Hotel',
    '430': 'Other Commercial',
    '500': 'Industrial',
    '600': 'Vacant Land',
    '700': 'Agricultural',
    '800': 'Transportation - Parking',
    '900': 'Exempt',
}
gdf['PROPERTY_CATEGORY'] = gdf['USE_CODE'].map(CATEGORY_MAP).fillna('Other')

# 3. Override: $0 improvement → Vacant Land
gdf.loc[gdf['IMPROVEMENT_VALUE'] <= 0, 'PROPERTY_CATEGORY'] = 'Vacant Land'

print(gdf['PROPERTY_CATEGORY'].value_counts())
```

When a city provides detailed assessor class codes, prefer a small city-specific classifier function over a flat one-to-one map. Split condos, townhomes/rowhouses, mixed-use parcels, hotels, office/commercial condos, and retail/general commercial when the source codes support those distinctions. Keep `Other Residential`, `Other Commercial`, and `Other` as residual buckets, then print the source-code counts inside those residuals and refine the mapping if they are large.

---

## Section 4 — Current Tax Model

Model current tax and validate revenue. See `model-policy.md` for the right approach depending on the city's assessment system.

```python
OFFICIAL_REVENUE = 45_000_000  # from city budget document

gdf['taxable_land_value'] = gdf['LAND_VALUE'].clip(lower=0)
gdf['taxable_improvement_value'] = gdf['IMPROVEMENT_VALUE'].clip(lower=0)

gdf['millage_rate'] = 9.5  # mills (from city budget)

current_revenue, _, gdf = calculate_current_tax(
    df=gdf,
    tax_value_col='TOTAL_VALUE',
    millage_rate_col='millage_rate',
    exemption_flag_col='full_exmp',
)

gap_pct = (current_revenue / OFFICIAL_REVENUE - 1) * 100
print(f"Modeled: ${current_revenue:,.0f}   Official: ${OFFICIAL_REVENUE:,.0f}   Gap: {gap_pct:+.2f}%")
assert abs(gap_pct) < 5.0, f"Revenue gap {gap_pct:.1f}% exceeds threshold"
```

---

## Section 5 — Split-Rate Model

```python
# Exclude fully-exempt parcels from the reform — AND from the modeled output.
# They carry no signal (current = new = $0): plotting them adds a meaningless "Exempt"
# bar and a spike at 0% in the distribution. Hold them out of the solver and do NOT add
# them back, so they never appear in the export or the report charts. Report them by
# count. (create_city_report also guards against any stray exempt rows.)
n_exempt = int((gdf['full_exmp'] == 1).sum())
gdf = gdf[gdf['full_exmp'] == 0].copy()

land_millage, improvement_millage, new_revenue, gdf = model_split_rate_tax(
    df=gdf,
    land_value_col='taxable_land_value',
    improvement_value_col='taxable_improvement_value',
    current_revenue=gdf['current_tax'].sum(),
    land_improvement_ratio=LAND_IMPROVEMENT_RATIO,
)

print(f"Held out {n_exempt:,} fully-exempt parcels (excluded from model, export, and charts).")
print(f"Land millage: {land_millage:.4f}   Improvement millage: {improvement_millage:.4f}")
print(f"Revenue check: ${new_revenue:,.0f}")

# Category summary (modeled parcels only)
category_summary = calculate_category_tax_summary(
    df=gdf,
    category_col='PROPERTY_CATEGORY',
    current_tax_col='current_tax',
    new_tax_col='new_tax',
)
print_category_tax_summary(category_summary, title=f"{CITY_NAME} — 4:1 Split-Rate Tax Impact")
```

> **Norm — fully-exempt parcels are excluded from the modeled output.** They are held out
> of the revenue-neutral solver and dropped here, so they do not appear as an "Exempt"
> category in the report or as a 0%-change spike in the distribution. Keep their count for
> the validation summary. If a city's data needs exempt parcels retained for some reason,
> say so explicitly in a markdown cell and note why.

> **Before moving on — read the results (artifact scan).** Do not treat "it ran" as "it's
> right." Print the category table and interpret it against economic priors *now* — see
> `validate.md` **Gate 5**. The most common canary is a set of distinct categories sharing a
> near-identical, extreme median (commercial/parking pinned at the same value as vacant
> land), which usually means missing/placeholder building values rather than a real result.

---

## Section 6 — Exploration Charts (optional)

Add any city-specific exploratory charts here. These are not part of the standard report. Examples:
- Bar chart of tax change by property category (quick visual)
- Scatter of land value vs. tax change
- Map of parcels colored by tax change direction

Keep these cells optional — they may be skipped when executing headlessly.

```python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')  # headless

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
summary = gdf.groupby('PROPERTY_CATEGORY')['tax_change_pct'].median()
summary.sort_values().plot.barh(ax=ax)
ax.set_title(f'{CITY_NAME} — Median Tax Change % by Category (4:1 Split-Rate)')
ax.set_xlabel('Median % Change')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig(DATA_DIR / 'category_preview.png', dpi=150)
plt.close()
```

---

## Section 7 — Census Join + Export (EXACT PATTERN — DO NOT MODIFY)

This section must appear verbatim as the final executable cells. Copy-paste exactly. Only change `CITY_NAME`, `STATE_FIPS + COUNTY_FIPS`, `output_path`, `model_type`, millage variable names, and column names.

```python
# Census join — must happen before export
import concurrent.futures
from lvt.census_utils import get_census_data_with_boundaries, match_to_census_blockgroups

_fips = STATE_FIPS + COUNTY_FIPS
try:
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1) as _ex:
        _future = _ex.submit(get_census_data_with_boundaries, _fips, 2022)
        try:
            census_data, census_gdf = _future.result(timeout=90)
            gdf = match_to_census_blockgroups(gdf, census_gdf)
            # census_gdf already carries demographics — spatial join adds them above.
            # Do NOT do a second gdf.merge(census_data) here: census_gdf has the columns
            # baked in, so a second merge creates median_income_x/y duplicates and silently
            # zeros out all demographic output.
            if 'minority_pct' not in gdf.columns and 'total_pop' in gdf.columns and 'white_pop' in gdf.columns:
                gdf['minority_pct'] = ((gdf['total_pop'] - gdf['white_pop']) / gdf['total_pop'] * 100).round(2)
            if 'black_pct' not in gdf.columns and 'total_pop' in gdf.columns and 'black_pop' in gdf.columns:
                gdf['black_pct'] = (gdf['black_pop'] / gdf['total_pop'] * 100).round(2)
            print(f"Census join: {gdf['std_geoid'].notna().mean()*100:.1f}% matched")
        except concurrent.futures.TimeoutError:
            print("Census API timed out — skipping census join")
            for _col in ['std_geoid', 'median_income', 'minority_pct', 'black_pct']:
                gdf[_col] = float('nan')
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Census join failed: {e}")
    for _col in ['std_geoid', 'median_income', 'minority_pct', 'black_pct']:
        gdf[_col] = float('nan')
```

```python
# Export — gdf must have census columns by this point
from lvt.lvt_utils import save_standard_export
out_df = save_standard_export(
    df=gdf,
    city=CITY_NAME,
    output_path=f'../../analysis/data/{CITY_NAME}.csv',
    model_type=MODEL_TYPE,
    land_millage=land_millage,
    improvement_millage=improvement_millage,
    property_category_col='PROPERTY_CATEGORY',
    current_tax_col='current_tax',
    new_tax_col='new_tax',
    tax_change_col='tax_change',
    tax_change_pct_col='tax_change_pct',
    taxable_land_col='taxable_land_value',
    taxable_improvement_col='taxable_improvement_value',
)

# Standard report — 7 PNGs in analysis/reports/<city>/
from lvt.viz import create_city_report
create_city_report(out_df, CITY_NAME, show=False)

# Parcel-map export — GeoParquet (geometry + tax outcomes + parcel id/owner/address) and a
# self-contained interactive HTML map colored by tax change. gdf must still carry geometry
# and the identity columns here — it does, since the model only ever row-filters gdf.
from lvt.parcel_map import save_parcel_map_export, create_parcel_map
map_gdf = save_parcel_map_export(
    gdf=gdf,
    city=CITY_NAME,
    output_path=f'../../analysis/maps/{CITY_NAME}.parquet',
    model_type=MODEL_TYPE,
    land_millage=land_millage,
    improvement_millage=improvement_millage,
    parcel_id_col=PARCEL_ID_COL,
    parcel_url_template=PARCEL_URL_TEMPLATE,
    owner_name_col=OWNER_NAME_COL,
    owner_address_col=OWNER_ADDRESS_COL,
    # simplify_tolerance_m=None,  # optionally lighten the STORED geometry for huge cities
)
create_parcel_map(map_gdf, CITY_NAME)  # simplifies only the viewer geometry, not the parquet
print("Done.")
```

`create_parcel_map` also embeds every report PNG sitting in `analysis/reports/<city>/`
as a click-through chart gallery below the map, so it must run **after** `create_city_report`
(and after any custom chart cells) — as it does in the closing pattern above.

For **large cities** (more than ~100k parcels) `create_parcel_map` automatically switches
from the inline single-file HTML to **vector tiles**: it builds `analysis/reports/<city>/<city>.pmtiles`
via tippecanoe and writes a MapLibre GL viewer. That tiled viewer must be opened over a
**range-capable** web server (plain `python3 -m http.server` can't byte-serve the tiles) — run
`python3 scripts/serve_maps.py` from the repo root and open the printed URL. Requires `tippecanoe`
and `ogr2ogr` (GDAL) on PATH; if absent, it falls back to the inline Leaflet map with a warning.

The parcel-map export is generic — it reuses the exact tax columns of the standard export
(via the shared `build_standard_export_frame`) and just adds geometry + identity columns.
It writes `analysis/maps/<city>.parquet` and `analysis/reports/<city>/parcel_map.html`
(both gitignored). For very large cities (150k+ parcels) the embedded GeoJSON gets big; pass
`simplify_tolerance_m` to `create_parcel_map` (default 2 m) to shrink the HTML, and consider
`simplify_tolerance_m` on the export too if the parquet itself needs to be lighter.

> **Metrics summary (automatic).** `create_city_report` also calls
> `lvt.metrics.compute_city_metrics`, which writes `metrics_summary.md` and
> `metrics_<city>.csv` into `analysis/reports/<city>/` and returns the metrics in the report
> dict. No extra notebook code is needed. The summary reports the full modeled tax base, the
> total dollars changed (Σ\|new − current\|) as a share of the modeled levy, and the value of
> vacant + underdeveloped land (improvement ratio <10% / 10-25% / 25-50%) as a share of the
> base. Roll up across cities with `lvt.metrics.rollup_city_metrics()`.

---

## Common Pitfalls

**Census data not showing in charts**: The census join result must be stored back into the same variable that is passed to `save_standard_export`. If you join census onto an intermediate GeoDataFrame, propagate those columns forward before calling export.

```python
# If census join used a different variable name:
_census_cols = ['std_geoid', 'median_income', 'minority_pct', 'black_pct', 'total_pop']
for _col in _census_cols:
    if _col in census_joined_gdf.columns:
        final_df[_col] = census_joined_gdf[_col]
```

**`show=False` is required** when executing headlessly — otherwise matplotlib blocks waiting for display.

**Import path**: Always `sys.path.insert(0, '../..')` from `cities/<city>/model.ipynb`.

**Kernel**: Always `python3`. Execute with:
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --inplace \
  --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 \
  --ExecutePreprocessor.kernel_name=python3 \
  model.ipynb
```
