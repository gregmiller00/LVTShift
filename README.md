# LVTShift

**LVTShift** is a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing and modeling Land Value Tax (LVT) policy shifts in U.S. counties and cities. Created by the Center for Land Economics ([landeconomics.org](https://landeconomics.org)), this package helps researchers, policymakers, and advocates understand how shifting from traditional property taxes to land value taxes would affect different neighborhoods, property types, and demographic groups.

## What is a Land Value Tax?

A **Land Value Tax** taxes only the value of land, not the buildings or improvements on that land. Unlike traditional property taxes that discourage development by taxing both land and buildings, LVT:

- **Encourages development** - No penalty for improving your property
- **Reduces speculation** - Makes it expensive to hold vacant land
- **Promotes affordable housing** - Removes the tax burden on new construction
- **Generates stable revenue** - Land values are more stable than building values

## What This Package Does

### üè† **Property Tax Modeling**
Transform your city's property tax data to model different LVT scenarios:
- **Split-rate taxes** (tax land at 3x, 4x, or any multiple of building rates)
- **Full building abatements** (eliminate taxes on improvements entirely)
- **Graduated exemptions** (phase in LVT with exemptions for smaller properties)
- **Revenue-neutral analysis** (maintain the same total tax revenue)

### üìä **Data Collection & Processing**
Automatically fetch and process the data you need:
- **Property records** from county GIS systems and open data portals
- **Tax assessment data** including land values, building values, and exemptions
- **Census demographics** (income, race, population) for equity analysis
- **Geographic boundaries** for mapping and spatial analysis

### üìà **Policy Impact Analysis**
Understand what problems LVT could help solve in your city:
- **Vacant land speculation** - Find concentrated vacant land holdings
- **Underutilized parking lots** - Identify prime development sites sitting empty
- **Development barriers** - Calculate how building taxes discourage construction
- **Housing supply impact** - Estimate how many new housing units LVT could enable

### üèòÔ∏è **Demographic & Equity Analysis**
Ensure your LVT policy is fair and equitable:
- **Income impact analysis** - How does LVT affect different income levels?
- **Racial equity assessment** - Are there disparate impacts by race/ethnicity?
- **Neighborhood analysis** - Which areas benefit vs. bear increased burden?
- **Property type breakdown** - How are different housing types affected?

## Real-World Example: South Bend, Indiana

Our main example analyzes a **4:1 split-rate tax** for South Bend, where land would be taxed at 4 times the rate of buildings. The analysis shows:

- **Single-family homes**: Most see modest tax decreases or increases
- **Vacant land**: Significant tax increases, encouraging development
- **Dense development**: Buildings with high improvement-to-land ratios benefit most
- **Revenue neutral**: Total city tax revenue stays the same

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/LVTShift.git
cd LVTShift
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables
```bash
# Copy the template and add your API keys
cp env.template .env
# Then edit .env with your actual API keys
```
You'll need:
- **Census API Key**: Get one free at [api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html)

### 3. Get Your Data
The package can work with any county that provides:
- Property tax assessment data (land value, building value, exemptions)
- Geographic boundaries (for mapping)
- Ideally available through an online GIS portal or API

### 4. Run the Analysis
```bash
cd examples
jupyter notebook southbend.ipynb
```

### 5. Adapt to Your City
The Spokane example (`examples/spokane.ipynb`) shows how to:
- Fetch data from different county systems
- Handle varying data formats and structures
- Customize the analysis for local policy questions

## Key Features by Module

### `census_utils.py` - Demographics Made Easy
```python
from census_utils import get_census_data_with_boundaries

# Get income and demographic data for any county
# API key is automatically loaded from environment variables
census_data, boundaries = get_census_data_with_boundaries(
    fips_code='18141',  # St. Joseph County, IN
    year=2022
)

# Or you can still pass the API key explicitly
census_data, boundaries = get_census_data_with_boundaries(
    fips_code='18141',  # St. Joseph County, IN
    year=2022,
    api_key='your_census_api_key_here'
)
```

### `cloud_utils.py` - Data Fetching
```python
from cloud_utils import get_feature_data_with_geometry

# Fetch property data from county GIS systems
parcels = get_feature_data_with_geometry(
    'Parcel_Civic', 
    'https://maps.saintjosephcounty.com/arcgis/rest/services/'
)
```

### `lvt_utils.py` - Tax Modeling
```python
from lvt_utils import model_split_rate_tax

# Model a 4:1 land-to-building tax ratio
land_rate, building_rate, revenue, results = model_split_rate_tax(
    df=property_data,
    land_value_col='land_value',
    improvement_value_col='improvement_value',
    current_revenue=current_tax_revenue,
    land_improvement_ratio=4
)
```

### `policy_analysis.py` - Problem Identification
```python
from policy_analysis import analyze_vacant_land, analyze_parking_lots

# Find vacant land speculation patterns
vacant_analysis = analyze_vacant_land(
    df=property_data,
    land_value_col='land_value',
    property_type_col='prop_use_desc'
)

# Identify underutilized parking lots
parking_analysis = analyze_parking_lots(
    df=property_data,
    land_value_col='land_value',
    improvement_value_col='improvement_value'
)
```

## Understanding the Output

### Tax Impact Analysis
- **Positive values**: Property owners pay more under LVT
- **Negative values**: Property owners pay less under LVT  
- **Revenue neutral**: Total city revenue remains unchanged

### Property Categories Most Affected
- **Vacant land**: Usually sees largest increases (good - discourages speculation)
- **Dense housing**: Usually sees decreases (good - rewards efficient land use)
- **Parking lots**: Often see increases (good - encourages better land use)
- **Single-family homes**: Mixed impacts depending on lot size vs. house value

### Equity Considerations
The analysis helps you answer:
- Do low-income neighborhoods disproportionately benefit or suffer?
- Are there racial equity implications?
- How can policy be designed to address any inequities?
